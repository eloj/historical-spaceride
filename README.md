The source file dates, preserved in the ZIP archive, are all from early 1994.

## History

"Gurra" is someone I went to school with for a while in the mid 1990s. I believe he may
have had some demo scene connection, but I can't remember a group name. A cursory
search of [csdb.dk](https://csdb.dk) and [pouet.net](https://www.pouet.net) didn't turn up anything.

Anyway. They wrote this code and it was eventually installed as a 'screensaver' on all
the computers on the Novell network in our lab.

I don't recall how I got access to the source, but it might be that I found it laying
around on a machine in the lab and made a copy.

## Notice

It goes without saying that you should NOT try to reach out through the
incredibly outdated contact information in the scroll text.

I wanted to preserve this as-is for historical reasons, so just don't be a dick.
